Hi! I'm Annalee. I'm a full-stack software developer living and working in Philly.

I got into software engineering because I like learning new things every day and in this field there is always something else to learn. Some of my current areas of interest are functional programming, data visualization, and progressive web apps.

My background includes teaching web development as a Teaching Fellow at the Grace Hopper Program, coordinating a STEM internship for highschool and college students at The Monell Center and studying English & Philosophy as an undergrad at Rutgers University

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
